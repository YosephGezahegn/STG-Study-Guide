        explanation:
          "Chapter 2 emphasizes the importance of antimicrobial stewardship, which includes initiating empiric therapy based on local data for severe infections and then narrowing the spectrum (de-escalation) once pathogen and susceptibility are known. Waiting for culture results in a severely ill patient can be dangerous, and using the broadest-spectrum agent or an agent with known high resistance is inappropriate. (Page 33)",

It is a movement disorder characterized by abrupt, non-rhythmic, involuntary movements (chorea), muscular weakness, and emotional disturbances. It is often a late manifestation, appearing months after the initial streptococcal infection. (Page 132)",

          "The main advantage of a bioprosthetic (tissue) valve is that it does not typically require long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. This makes it a preferred choice for patients who cannot take anticoagulants or wish to avoid them. The trade-off is that these valves are less durable than mechanical valves and may require re-operation in the future. (Page 137)",

          "Since the culture identified *Klebsiella pneumoniae* which is sensitive to **Ceftriaxone**, and the initial regimen (Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole) was empiric, the Metronidazole can be discontinued. The Pyogenic liver abscess is often polymicrobial, but culture-directed therapy should guide the final antibiotic choice. Since anaerobes are difficult to culture, Metronidazole is often maintained even if the aerobic culture is positive. However, *Klebsiella* is covered by Ceftriaxone (a single antibiotic) which is sensitive. **Monotherapy with Ceftriaxone** is sufficient to treat the identified pathogen and continue the total course[cite: 1075].

    question: "Which of the following laboratory findings in a 40-year-old non-immune adult with *P. falciparum* infection is considered a definitive criterion for severe malaria?",
    choices: [
      "A. Fever (39.5°C)",
      "B. Jaundice (Total Bilirubin 2.5 mg/dL)",
      "C. Serum lactate 6.0 mmol/L (Hyperlactatemia)",
      "D. Parasite load 15%"
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    topic: "Chapter 8.5 Malaria",
    explanation: "Hyperparasitemia is defined as **parasite load >20%** in non-immune adults, or **>5% in non-immune** (p 352). The source text lists parasite load >5% in non-immune adults as hyperparasitemia, and >20% in adults as another criterion. A parasite load of 15% in a non-immune adult generally meets the criteria (>5%) for severe malaria. Hyperlactatemia is defined as lactate >5 mmol/L, making option C also technically correct for severe malaria based on specific criteria, but severe hyperparasitemia (>5% non-immune) is a primary, definitive criterion. Since the source uses multiple parasite load definitions, choosing the highest threshold for severe malaria (Hyperparasitemia >5% in non-immune, >20% in adults) is safest. If the patient is non-immune (implied by the case), >5% constitutes hyperparasitemia. Since 15% definitely exceeds 5%, this indicates severe malaria. Given the options, **Parasite load 15%** is a clear indicator of severe disease in a non-immune adult.",
