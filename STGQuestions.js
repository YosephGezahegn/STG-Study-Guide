        explanation:
          "Chapter 2 emphasizes the importance of antimicrobial stewardship, which includes initiating empiric therapy based on local data for severe infections and then narrowing the spectrum (de-escalation) once pathogen and susceptibility are known. Waiting for culture results in a severely ill patient can be dangerous, and using the broadest-spectrum agent or an agent with known high resistance is inappropriate. (Page 33)",

It is a movement disorder characterized by abrupt, non-rhythmic, involuntary movements (chorea), muscular weakness, and emotional disturbances. It is often a late manifestation, appearing months after the initial streptococcal infection. (Page 132)",

          "The main advantage of a bioprosthetic (tissue) valve is that it does not typically require long-term anticoagulation with warfarin. This makes it a preferred choice for patients who cannot take anticoagulants or wish to avoid them. The trade-off is that these valves are less durable than mechanical valves and may require re-operation in the future. (Page 137)",

          "Since the culture identified *Klebsiella pneumoniae* which is sensitive to **Ceftriaxone**, and the initial regimen (Ceftriaxone + Metronidazole) was empiric, the Metronidazole can be discontinued. The Pyogenic liver abscess is often polymicrobial, but culture-directed therapy should guide the final antibiotic choice. Since anaerobes are difficult to culture, Metronidazole is often maintained even if the aerobic culture is positive. However, *Klebsiella* is covered by Ceftriaxone (a single antibiotic) which is sensitive. **Monotherapy with Ceftriaxone** is sufficient to treat the identified pathogen and continue the total course[cite: 1075].
