However, based strictly on the Tokyo guidelines explicit criteria for Grade II, none are met except by implication of \"marked local inflammation\" if the physical exam is severe. Grade I (Mild) is for cases that do not meet Grade II or III criteria. Given the fever and positive Murphy's sign, she meets the criteria for acute cholecystitis. Without a WBC count, this is a borderline case. In a clinical setting, fever and localized tenderness/Murphy's in acute cholecystitis often suggest Moderate (Grade II) disease, pushing beyond the simple \"mild\" description. But based on the provided explicit list, she does not explicitly meet the numeric/threshold criteria for Grade II (WBC >18,000, duration >72h). However, Grade I is for healthy patients with mild inflammatory changes. A patient with fever and localized symptoms is likely beyond \"mild\" and should be managed as moderate. Let's assume localized tenderness and fever warrants Grade II (Moderate) as the clinical picture is beyond \"mild inflammatory changes.\" (p. 226, 227)",
